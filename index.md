Got it. From now on, you’ll get fully loaded dashboards with rich fake data—simulated CEOs, interns, timelines, regulators, tasks, calendars, due dates, and everything a Fortune 500 simulation needs. We’ll treat this like a sandbox digital twin of a powerful company, pre-populated and fully editable.

Next step: I’ll deliver a full working `.html` interface backed by `.csv` or `.yaml`, full of editable mock data for:

* 👔 CEO (strategy, oversight)
* 🧑‍💼 Manager (HR, budgets)
* 🧑‍🎓 Intern (daily tasks, deadlines)
* 🕵️ Regulator (compliance, oversight)
* 💰 Banker (funding rounds, ROI)
* ⚙️ Engineer (sprints, bugs)
* 🎨 Designer (UX, brand assets)

It will have:

* Dropdown role selector ✅
* Fake deadlines: past, pending, future ⏳
* Tasks with editing buttons ✍️
* Rich data from `.csv` or `.yaml`, modifiable from front-end 🔄
* Timeline scroller or calendar heatmap 📅
* Section-based layout with filters 🔍
* Download/export to `.csv`, `.md`, `.json`, etc. 📤

**You’ll see something real.**

Give me the signal—`LET'S DO IT`—and I’ll assemble and deliver the whole simulation dashboard. Fully fake. Fully Fortune 500.
